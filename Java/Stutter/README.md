Stutter is a miniature Lisp-like interpreter.

It parses input into a tree data structure then recursively evaluates it.


Strings other than numbers aren't supported.


TODO: make it a GUI, implement functions?


Each command must be in parenthesis and in prefix notation:
i.e.
(+ 1 2)
would return 3.
(+ 3 4 (* 4 5))
would return 32
